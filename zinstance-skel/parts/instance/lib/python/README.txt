This directory will hold any additional Python packages installed into
this Zope instance.  Installing Distutils-based packages should be
done using the command:

  /plone/Python-2.4/bin/python setup.py install --home /plone/zinstance/parts/instance

This will cause the newly installed Python packages to appear in this
directory.
